# Locals

* We can use some variables only in local, or we can make some calculs in local then use that result in the main
Local same as tfvars but, in the main you have to say you are using local NOT var.

### one more remark

* You can use local even never creating a VARIABLE file.
*  And I am trying to delete a resource from terraform simply commenting the resource bloc
